## 7.1 Assurance of Corporate Security
### Assurance and Evaluation
- Security assurance is the degree of confidence one has that the security controls operate correctly and protect the system as intended.
- Assurance is not, however, an absolute guarantee that the measures work as intended.s

### Requirements
- Target of Evaluation (TOE) refers to the part of the product or system that is subject to evaluation.
- The requirements fall into two categories:
  - Functional requirements
    - Define desired security behavior
  - Assurance requirements
    - The basic for gaining confidence that the claimed security measures are effective and implemented correctly.

### Target Audience
1. Comusmers
   - Select security features and functions for a system and determine the required level of security assurance.
2. Developers
   - Respond to actual or perceived consumer security requirements, interpret statements of assurance requirements, and determine assurance approaches and level of effort.
3. Evaluators (third party or same organization as consumer)
   - Use the assurance requirements as a mandatory statement of evaluation criteria when evaluting security features and controls.

### Scope of Assurance
1. Requirements
   - This category refers to the security requirements for a product.
2. Security policy
   - Based on the requirements, a security policy can be defined. 
3. Product design
   - Based on requirements and security policy.
4. Product Implementation
   - Based on the design.
5. System operation
   - Includes ordinary use plus maintenance.

### Approaches to Provide Assurance
- Analysis and Checking of processes and procedures
- Checking that processes and procedures are being applied
- Analysis of the correspondence between TOE design representations
- Analysis of the TOE design representation against the requirements
- Verification of proofs
- Analysis of guidance documents
- Analysis of functional tests developed and the results provided
- Independent functional testing
- Analysis for vulnerabilities
- Penetration testing

### Element of Assurance
1. System architecture
   - Addresses both the system development phase and the system operations phase.
2. System integrity
   - Addresses the correct operation of the system hardware and firmware and is typically satisfied by periodic use of diagnostic software.
3. System testing
   - Ensures that the security features have been tested thoroughly. This includes testing of functional operations, testing of security requirements, and testing of possible penetrations.
4. Design specification and verification
   - Addresses the correctness of the system design and implementation with respect to the system security policy. Ideally, formal methods of verification can be used.

## 7.2 Evaluation of Corporate Security and Ways Forward
### Trusted Computer System Evaluation (TCSEC)
- Criteria published in the [Orange Book](https://csrc.nist.gov/files/pubs/conference/1998/10/08/proceedings-of-the-21st-nissc-1998/final/docs/early-cs-papers/dod85.pdf)
- Officially replaced by Common Criteria
- Four levels
- A Verified protection
  - A1 Verified Design
- B Mandatory Protection
  - B1 Labeled Security
  - B2 Structured Protection
  - B3 Security Domains
- C Discretionary Protection
  - C1 Discretionary Security
  - C2 Controlled Access
- D Minimal Security

### Information Technology Security Evaluation Criteria [ITSEC](https://www.sogis.eu/documents/itsec/itsec-en.pdf)
1. Used primarily in Europe
2. Target of Evaluation (TOE) is either product or system
3. Two ratings
   - Functionality rating (F1 to F10)
   - Assurance rating (E0 to E6)

|ITSEC|TCSEC|
|---|---|
|E0|D|
|F1+E1|C1|
|F2+E2|C2|
|F3+E3|B1|
|F4+E4|B2|
|F5+E5|B3|
|F6+E6|A1|
|F6 = system that provide high integrity |
|F7 = system that provide high availability |
|F8 = system that provide data integrity during communication |
|F9 = system that provide high confidentiality |
|F10 = network with high demands on confidentiality and integrity |

### Common Criteria
1. ISO standard evaluation criteria that combines several different criteria, including TCSEC and ITSEC.
2. Participating governments recognize Common Criteria certifications awarded in other nations.
3. Seven Evaluation Assurance Levels (EAL1-7)
   - Security functional requirements 
   - Security assurance requirements
4. Utilizes Protection Profiles (PP)

#### Evaluation Assurance Levels
1. Define a scale for measuring the criteria for the evaluation of PPs (Protection Profiles) and STs (Security Targets).
2. Constructed using components from the assurance families
3. Organization
   - Seven hierarchically ordered EALs in a uniformly increasing scale of assurance

#### CC EALS - Reference
|Level|Short Title|US TCSEC|
|---|---|---|
|EAL1|Functionally Tested|D|
|EAL2|Structurally Tested|C1|
|EAL3|Methodically Tested and Checked|C2|
|EAL4|Methodically Designed, Tested, and Reviewed|B1|
|EAL5|Semiformally Designed and Tested|B2|
|EAL6|Semiformally Verified Design and Tested|B3|
|EAL7|Formally Verified Design and Tested|A1|

### CC EALS - Summary
1. EAL 1 - Functionally tested
  - "Applicable where some confidence in correct operation is required, but the threats to security are not viewed as serious."
2. EAL 2 - Structurally tested
  - "Applicable where developers or users require a low to moderate level of independently assured security"
3. EAL 3 - Methodically tested and checked
  - "Applicable where the requirement is for a moderate level of independently assured security"
4. EAL 4 - Methodically designed, tested, and reviewed
  - "Applicable where developers or users require a moderate to high level of independently assured security"
5. EAL 5 - Semi-formally designed and tested
  - "Applicable where the requirement is for a high level of independently assured security"
6. EAL 6 - Semi-formally verified design and tested 
  - "Applicable to the development of specialized TOEs (Target of Evaluation), for high risk situations."
7. EAL 7 - Formally verified design and tested
  - "Applicable to the development of security TOEs for application in extremely high risk situations."

- [Common Criteria Document](https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/files/ccfiles/CEMV3.1R5.pdf)

### Elements of Assurance
1. Convert channel analysis
   - This type of analysis attempts to identify and potential means for bypassing security policy and ways to reduce or eliminate such possibilities.
2. Trusted facility management
   - Deals with system administration. One approach is to separate the roles of system operator and security administrator.
   - Another approach is detailed specification of policies and procedures with mechanisms for review.
3. Trusted recovery
   - Provides for correct operation of security features after a system recovers from failures, crashes, or security incidents.
4. Trusted distribution
   - Ensures that protected hardware, firmware, and software do not go through unauthorized changes
5. Configuration management
   - Requirements are included for configuration control, audit, management, and accounting.

### Parties Involved in Evaluation
1. Sponsor
   - Either the customer or the vendor of a product.
   - Sponsors determine the security target.
2. Developer
   - Has to provide suitable evidence on the processes used to design, implement, and the test the product to enable its evaluation.
3. Evaluator
   - Performs the technical evaluation work, using the evidence supplied by the developers, and additional testing of the product, to confirm that it satisfies the functional and assurance requirements specified in the security target.
4. Certifier
   - The government agency that monitors the evaluation process and subsequently certifies that a product as been successfully evaluated.

### Evaluation Phases
1. Preparation
   - Involves the initial contact between the sponsor and developers of a product, and the evaluators who will assess it.
2. Conduct of Evaluation
   - A structured and formal process in which the evaluators conduct a series of activities specified by the CC.
3. Conclusion
   - The evaluators provide the final evaluation technical report to the certifiers for acceptance. The certifiers use this report, which may contain confidential information, to validate the evaluation process and to prepare a public certification report.
