## 8.1 Security Model
1. All complex software systems have eventually revealed flaws or bugs that need to be fixed.
2. It is extraordinarily difficult to build computer hardware/software not vulnerable to security attack.
3. Problems involved both design and implementation led to developement of formal security models.
4. A model is a simplified representation used to explain a real-world system.

## Bell-LaPadula Security Model
1. Developed in 1970s 
2. Formal model for access control
3. Subjects and objects are assigned a security class
4. Form a hierarchy and are referred to as security levels
5. A subject has a security clearance
6. An object has a security classification
7. Security classes control the manner by which a subject may access an object

| Security Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Top Secret | Highest level of classification |
| Secret | Second highest level of classification |
| Confidential | Third highest level of classification |
| Unclassified | Lowest level of classification |

8. The model is based on two properties:
   - **Simple Security Property**: No read up
   - **Star Property**: No write down
   - A subject can read all documents at or below his level of security, but cannot read any document above his level of security. (No Read Up, NRU)
   - A subject can write to all documents at or above his level of security, but cannot write to any document below his level of security. (No Write Down, NWD)

### Access Privileges
1. Read
   - The subject is allowed only read access to the object.
2. Append
   - The subject is allowed only write access to the object.
3. Write
   - The subject is allowed both read and write access to the object.
4. Execute
   - The subject is allowed neither read nor write access to the object but may invoke the object for execution.

### Example
| Subject | Security Level | Object |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tamara | Top Secret | Personnel Files |
| Samuel | Secret | E-Mail Files |
| Claire | Confidential | Activity Logs |
| James | Unclassified | Telephone Lists |

1. Tamara can read all files
2. Claire cannot read Personnel or E-Mail files
3. James can only read Telephone Lists

## Biba Security Model
1. Developed in 1970s
2. First formal integrity model
3. Addresses shortcoming in Bell-LaPadula:
   - a subject at a lower security level can overwrite and potentially destroy secret information at a higher level. (even though they cannot see it)
   - a subject cannot write documents above his level (no write up, NWU)
   - a subject cannot read documents below his level (no read down, NRD)

## Clark-Wilson Security Model
1. Integrity model with two principals:
   - Transformation Procedures (TP)
2. Operates on two types of data:
   - Unconstrained Data Items (UDI) -> not covered by policy
   - Constrained Data Items (CDI)
3. One type of TP, called an *integrity verification procedure*, is used to transform CDIs into UDIs.
4. Very practical; used in commercial world.
5. Two sets of rule:
   - Certification (C)
   - Enforcement (E) rules
