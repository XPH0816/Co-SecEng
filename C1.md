## 1.2 Security vs Dependability

1. Dependability = Security + Reliability
2. Reliability and security are often correlated in practice

2. [Mechanism](#mechanism)
3. [Assurance](#assurance)
4. [Incentive/Motivation](#incentivemotivation)

### Policy
- What you are supposed to achieve
### Mechanism
- Tools you assemble in order to implement the policy
### Assurance
- The amount of reliance you can place on each particular mechanism
### Incentive/Motivation
1. The motive that the people guarding and maintaining the system to do their job properly
2. The motive that the attackers have to try to defeat your policy

6. Trustworthy
   - System or component is one that won't fail
7. Secrecy
   - technical term which refers to the effect of the mechanism used to limit the number of principals who can access information, such as cryptography or computer access controls.
8. Confidentiality

graph TD
    F@{ shape: braces, label: "Resources have classifications, people (principals) have clearances. Information flows upwards only" } --> G@{ shape: braces, label: "Clearance - allow access to the classification resources. Otherwise, information is forbidden" }
    A[Top Secret] --> B[Secret] --> C[Confidential] --> D[Restricted] --> E[Unclassified]
```

### Description
1. Top Secret
   - Compromise could cost many lives or do exceptionally grave damage to operations
   - E.g. intelligence sources and methods
2. Secret
   - Compromise could threaten lives directly
   - E.g. weapon system performance 
3. Confidential
   - compromise could damage to operations
4. Restricted
   - compromise could lead to criminal charges or cause irreparable damage to company

## 1.7 Three Pillars of Security
1. People
   - Everyone in the business needs to be aware of their role in preventing and reducing cyber threats, whether it's handling sensitive data, understanding how to spot phishing emails, or the use of BYOD. 
2. Processes
   - Defining how the organization's activities, roles and documentation are used to mitigate the risks to the organization's information.
3. Technology
   - Technology can be deployed to prevent or reduce the impact of cyber risks, depending on the risks assessment and what you deem an acceptable level of risk.

### Terms
1. BYOD
   - Bring Your Own Device
   - E.g. smartphones, tablets, and laptops
