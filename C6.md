## 6.1 Management of Security Standards
A process used to achieve and maintain appropriate levels of confidentiality, integrity, availability, accountability, authenticity, and reliability.

IT security management functions include:
1. Determining organizational security objectives, strategies, and policies
2. Determining analyzing security threats to IT assets within the organization
3. Identifying and analyzing risks
4. Specifying appropriate safeguards
5. Monitoring the implementation and operation safeguards that are necessary in order to cost effectively protect the information and services within the organization
6. Developing and implementing a security awareness program
7. Detecting and reacting to incidents

### The Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) Model
#### Plan
1. Establish the security policies, objectives, processes and procedures relevant to managing risk and improving information security to deliver results in accordance with an organization's overall policies and objectives.

#### Do
1. Implement and operate the security policy, controls, processes and procedures.

#### Check
1. Assess and, where applicable, measure performance against security policy, objectives and practical experience and report the results to management for review.

#### Act
1. Take corrective and preventive actions, based on the results of the internal audit and management review or other relevant information, to achieve continual improvement of the security management process.

## 6.2 Corporate Security Policy & Resources
### ISO 27000 Series and Related Standards
| Standard | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ISO 27000 | Overview and **vocabulary** |
| ISO 27001 | Defines the **specification and requirements** for an ISMS against which organizations are formally certified |
| ISO 27002 | **Code of practice** detailing the comprehensive set of information security control objectives and controls |
| ISO 27003 | **Implementation Guidelines** on the use of the 27000 series of standards following the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle |
| ISO 27004 | **Measurement and report the effectiveness** of an ISMS |
| ISO 27005 | **Risk Management** |

### IT Security Management Controls and Implementation
1. **Security Controls**
   - Some controls address multiple risks at the same time and selecting such controls can be very cost effective.
   - **Management Controls**
     - security policies, planning, guidelines, and standards that influence the selection of operational and technical controls to reduce risk.
   - **Oerational**
     - address the correct implementation and use of security policies, and standards, ensuring consistency in security operations and correcting identified operational deficiencies. These controls relate to mechanisms and procedures that are primarily implemented by people rather than systems.
   - **Technical**
     - Involve the correct use of hardware, software security capabilities in systems. These range from simple to complex measures that work together to secure critical and sensitive data, information, and IT systems functions.

### Security and Project Management
1. Requirements and scope
2. The technical plan
   1. Project life cycle
   2. Activities required to complete deliverables
3. Resources 
   1. Skills needed
   2. Facilities, tools
4. Estimates
   1. Duration of resource requirements
   2. Other related estimates such as size and defects
5. Project and product risks

#### Project Requirements and Scope
1. Scope is influenced by
   1. Type and number of threats
   2. Sophistication and resources available to the attacker
   3. Desired response to an attack
   4. The level of assurance required that the system meets its security requirements
2. Risk assessment should aid in identifying the highest priority security threats and the profiles of the most likely attackers.

#### Technical Plan
1. Project life cycle
   1. close tie between the outcome of risk analysis and requirements
   2. as risk analysis helps to define the scope for security in terms of the threats to be considered, the response desired, and the assurance level required for that response.
2. Risk and threat analysis
   1. risk assessment explores how a component could be exploited by the identified threats
   2. The response options for a risk are:
      1. ignore/accept 
      2. mitigate/reduce 
      3. transfer 
      4. avoid the risk (by changing in requirements

#### Resources
1. Tools
   1. specialized software tools (e.g., static code analysis, to aid the production or testing of secure software)
2. Facilities and staffing
   1. Security expertise on most projects is limited and may be an internal or a contracted service.

#### Estimates
1. Duration of resource requirements
   1. The planning for security testing should start after the architecture is defined.
   2. Risk analysis has to be a continuing activity but the specific expertise required may vary.
   3. Architectural risk analysis can take advantage of both domain and a breadth of architectual experience.
   4. The analysis of a detailed design may require in-depth knowledge of the specific technology, while the analysis of an implementation draws on a detailed knowledge of known exploits.
2. Other related estimates such as
   1. Software vulnerabilities may be intentionally inserted during in-house or contracted development.
   2. Some security risks are inherent in the operating environment or with the desired functionality and hence are unavoidable.

#### Trustworthy Computing Security Development Lifecycle (SDL)
1. **Secure Work Instruction**
   1. Detail instructions that outline safe and secure procedures for performing specific tasks or operations, particularly in environments where security and compliance are essential.
